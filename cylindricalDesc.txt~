Cylindrical Coordinates

First, we warped our images into cylindrical coordinates using the following two equations:
	
	theta = arctan(x / f);
	h = y / sqrt(x^2 + f^2);

In the above equations, f is the focal length, x is the x coordinate of the 2-d image representation, and y is the y coordinate of the 2-d image representation.  This gave us a cylindrical coordinate for each of our x,y positions in our images.  After this conversion, we warped our images back into cylindrical image coordinates using the following equations.
	
	new_x = f * theta + x_center;
	new_y = f * h + y_center;

In the above equations, the terms x_center and y_center represent the center of the unwrapped cylinder for the cylindrical coordinates.  We used these new_x and new_y values to recreate our original images as cylindrical images.
